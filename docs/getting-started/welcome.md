# Welcome

[Linkwarden](https://linkwarden.app) is a self-hosted, open-source collaborative bookmark manager to collect, organize and archive webpages. The objective is to organize useful webpages and articles you find across the web in one place, and since useful webpages can go away (see the inevitability of [Link Rot](https://blog.linkwarden.app/articles/link-rot-and-its-impact-on-the-web)), Linkwarden also saves a copy of each webpage as a Screenshot and PDF, ensuring accessibility even if the original content is no longer available.
Additionally, Linkwarden is designed with collaboration in mind, sharing links with the public and/or allowing multiple users to work together seamlessly.

This is the documentation for Linkwarden. Our documentation is a great place to find most answers.

Something missing? Please [Contact Us](mailto:support@linkwarden.app) so we can update the documentation. Thanks and enjoy Linkwarden!

There's an "**Edit this page**" link at the bottom of each page. If you come across any typos, issues, or unclear content, please feel free to submit a pull request to contribute and improve the page.
