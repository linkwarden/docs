# Welcome

**[Linkwarden](https://linkwarden.app) is a self-hosted, open-source collaborative bookmark manager to collect, read, annotate, and fully preserve what matters, all in one place.**

The objective is to organize useful webpages and articles you find across the web in one place, and since useful webpages can go away (see the inevitability of [Link Rot](https://blog.linkwarden.app/articles/link-rot-and-its-impact-on-the-web)), Linkwarden also saves a copy of each webpage in multiple formats, ensuring accessibility even if the original content is no longer available.

In addition to preservation, Linkwarden provides a user-friendly reading and annotation experience that blends the simplicity of a “read-it-later” tool with the reliability of a web archive. Whether you’re highlighting key ideas, jotting down thoughts, or revisiting content long after it’s disappeared from the web, Linkwarden keeps your knowledge accessible and organized.

Linkwarden is also designed with collaboration in mind, enabling you to share links with the public and/or collaborate seamlessly with multiple users.

This is the documentation for Linkwarden. Our documentation is a great place to find most answers.
