## Get The App

**To use the mobile app you’ll first need a Linkwarden account.**

You can choose between:

- [**Linkwarden Cloud**](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing) – instant setup, and your subscription directly supports ongoing development.
- [**Self-hosted Linkwarden**](https://docs.linkwarden.app/self-hosting/installation) – free, but you’ll need to deploy and maintain a Linkwarden instance on a server.

After creating an account, download the app from your preferred store:

[![Get it on Google Play](/img/google_play.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.linkwarden)

(To get the app as an APK outside Google Play, check out our [builds](https://github.com/linkwarden/builds) repository.)

## One Time Setup

You can login to the app either by entering your username and password, or by creating an access token from Settings > Access Tokens.
