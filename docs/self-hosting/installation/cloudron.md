# Cloudron

:::tip

Our official [Cloud](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing) offering is the easiest way to start using Linkwarden and is typically more affordable than renting a VPS.

Plus, your subscription supports both the development and the continuous improvement of the app for everyone!

Alternatively, if you prefer self-hosting Linkwarden, no problem! You still have access to all the core features.

:::

Cloudron is a complete solution for running apps on your server and keeping them
up-to-date and secure. If you don't have Cloudron installed on a server you can follow
the [installation instructions here ](https://docs.cloudron.io/installation/). Ensure
you follow the installation guide to the end and log into the Cloudron app store. Once
you have Cloudron installed and running on your service you can follow the steps below
to install the Linkwarden app.
